    <p> I live in Uk and I enrolled for FullStack Web development On March 2023.Since then<br> I am studding full time and I am planning to find a job as a web development.I am a<br> reflector, theorist, and pragmatist. As a reflector, I always prefer to do the job by looking<br>
         at the instructor first. I would like to analyse data. My reflector 
         strengths are careful,<br> Thorough, and methodical, Thoughtful, and good at listening to others, assimilating<br>
          information, and rarely jumping to conclusions.
        As a theorist, I tend to be a perfectionist<br> who wonâ€™t rest easy until things are tidy and fit into a rational scheme.
         I like to analyse<br> and synthesize. As a pragmatist, I would like to try things out, apply things to their role,<br> and solve problems practically.I am a plant and tend to be creative, imaginative, free-thinking,<br> generate ideas and solve difficult problems.
